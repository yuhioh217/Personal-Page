            Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have
            learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing massive
            amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem massive,
            monolithic and worth your attention.

            Yes I know you probably disregarded the earlier boasts as
            non-sequitur filler content, but it's really true. It took years of
            gene splicing and combinatory DNA research, but our bananas can
            really dance.
